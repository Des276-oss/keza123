<p class=" bb">A website is a way for a business to reach potential clients and customers locally and around the globe. For a business, a website can contribute to expansion, growth, and an increase in profits. Creating a business website with purpose will ensure that it reaches its potential for success.A business’s online presence, regardless of industry, can have a massive impact on its success. In this day and age, some businesses still don’t realize that a majority of their customers will visit their website before making a purchase.

Having a strong online presence, particularly a website, can be make or break for generating more revenue. Yes, the quality of your website impacts results, but the purpose of this article to stress the importance of making sure you have a website.

I've helped numerous companies of varying sizes create their digital presences. In some cases, organizations are hesitant to get online because they feel they are not tech-savvy enough and don't understand how to manage a website. Other times, companies are concerned about the price.</p>
